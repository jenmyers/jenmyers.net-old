##Jenmyers.net

My personal website, publicly available for review and feedback as I make it better.

###Features

* My articles, categorized by design, coding, culture and philosophy (the last of which is a fancy-sounding title for stuff that doesn't fit elsewhere).

* Info on my work, speaking events and background.

* Powered by Ruby CMS [Nesta](http://www.nestacms.com). My first attempt in keeping my weblog not only in a Ruby app.

* Hosted on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).

* Happily using [Compass](http://www.compass-style.org).

###Tasks

I have quite a few things to improve here.

* Style error page.

* Fix/style category listings.

* Implement responsive views

* Add work portfolio content.
