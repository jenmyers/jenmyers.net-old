Title: Truth or Consequences
Template: page-alt

The clearest and most profound lesson I learned growing up was how to lie. It was the only example provided, the only tool identified for survival. Of course, it was never deliberate. My family was not a family of con artists, but one that made an art out of denial, avoidance, rationalization and silence. Lying was for our own protection, and the protection of the facade we subsequently needed that everything was okay. And so I became adept not only at lying, but lying about the fact that what I was really doing, in the end, was lying.

My parents were deeply repressed, self-doubting people who passed for normal and healthy. As many people do. When I was eight, they divorced. I later learned (from listening to adult conversation when they decided to not acknowledge my presence) it was the result of my mother’s affair and resulting pregnancy. After the divorce and the birth of my half-sister, I realized something was amiss and asked my father how the baby had come to be if he and my mother weren’t together anymore. He told me the baby had started beforehand. Neither he or my mother ever took it upon themselves to tell me the truth. Even after it was acknowledged my sister had another father. It was like nothing had ever happened. Even when the present situation was clearly different. As long as we acted like nothing bad had ever happened, nothing had.

Life after the divorce was even more repressed, silent and lonely. We just folded inward. My brother and I learned not to ask questions and not to talk about anything that was uncomfortable or problematic. We didn’t even have language to talk about what we felt. I was very young when I began to read and write more than I spoke. It was easier. There were days of my life when I did not speak to another person from morning until night. My father worked long, back-breaking hours. My mother lived many years on the poverty line, raising my half-sister on her own. We didn’t talk about money. We didn’t talk about work. We didn’t talk about help. We were alone, each isolated on our islands, and we took it for granted that nothing could change.

As a teenager, after having been was raised in the complete absence of religion, I tried believing in God. It was less about belief in a deity than it was about my desperate need to think I could talk to someone and someone cared what I had to say. It didn’t stick, though. My newfound faith lasted but a few months before I surrendered again to my reality.

At some point, I started to hate lies. I hadn’t even yet recognized my and my family’s behavior as lying. I just developed an instinctive, burning hatred of untruths and leaving things deliberately unsaid, even as I did it myself. It wasn’t even the big lies, either. In fact, I despised the small lies more than anything. Those tiny moments when we opted for comforting fiction, shortcuts and ease, rather than a simple truth. Everyone seemed to do that. It was even logical and apparent to me why we all did it. It just made sense. If we could save ourselves or others inconvenience or pain, why not? The ends justified the means.

Except a lifetime of sacrificing the honor of the means had given me an end with which I literally couldn’t live. My first two years of college, my first out in the world and away from the safe little bubble of avoidance, broke me. The only life skills I had were running away from pain and discomfort. I didn’t know how to talk to people. I chose not completing a task or promise rather than ask for help or admit I didn’t know how to do it. I was terrified of doing something wrong. I didn’t know how to better myself, because I had to face my flaws first in order to do it, which was impossible. When in a difficult situation, I immediately concluded I needed to put myself in a different situation, and the best way to do that was to leave, quickly and silently and no matter what mess I left behind for other people to clean up. At the end of two years, I imploded and went home.

I don’t know what flipped the switch for me. Something did, at least halfway. After another year of confusion, I returned to school and made a concentrated effort to reach out and grow. I made some progress. But I still hadn’t met my crucible. The event I needed to finally force me to face myself and make a decision about my life. That happened when I found myself pregnant.

The power of human denial is an incredible thing. Absolutely incredible. It can warp minds and twist lives. I was able to employ it more than four months to deny I was pregnant. I knew I was pregnant. But I gained little weight and hid it easily and I was so used to automatically pushing inconvenient truth aside, it made sense not to deal with it. Until I had to deal with it. A lifetime of practicing how to avoid dealing with difficulty and finally I was in a difficult situation where, no question about it, I had to deal with it. And dealing with it meant making a choice.

I have written before about that choice (http://jenmyers.tumblr.com/post/5803326130/revelations-and-rebirths). It is the instance that separates my life in two parts, into the time when I lived in fear and denial and irresponsibility and the time where I accepted accountability and the price of growing up. I chose to keep my daughter. I was alone and broke and I didn’t know what I was going to do. But I decided to make it work. And I decided I was going to change everything.

Six years later, I have changed everything. I’ve worked and struggled and I’m finally stable. My daughter is healthy and happy. Those who know me now never even guess that other person I’ve described here ever existed. They know a bright, outgoing, confident woman. That’s a good thing. But the past is a part of me. It always will be. That is also a good thing.

I’m reminded of it not by simple memory, but by the fact that I’m still fighting another, related battle. Over two years ago, I met a man I fell in love with. I didn’t think that would happen to me. I was used to thinking of myself as alone. Obviously. The men in my life I had previously dared to trust had failed me, without exception. This one asked me to trust him. When we ran into the wall of my protective independence and distrust, he called me on it. He said if we were going to be together, I needed to trust and rely on him. I realized he was right. So I did.

Now, when I think about him, I’m not sure who really he was. When I first met him, Matt was open and strong. He was curious and adventurous. When I asked him difficult questions, he made an effort to address them, even if they made him uncomfortable or he didn’t know the answer. That, and his openness in discussing how he wanted me to trust him so we could be together, made me trust him.

But I was still learning, and, about a year down the road, communication became increasingly difficult. I felt that while I was training myself to rely on him, he was starting to pull away. The more he pulled away, the more I scrambled to keep the balance we had previously established, the balance he had told me he wanted. I saw more often another person in him. This person held back. At events with my friends, he held himself apart, even though I tried to bring him into the group and show him he was accepted. There were more heavy silences when I knew things were going unsaid. I tried so hard to reach him. After he moved back from another city, ostensibly to live with me and solve our problems, I told him it didn’t matter where either one of us was physically - all that mattered is we were connecting and communicating. And if we weren’t doing that, we could be living in the same house and still not really being together.

I fought hard for him. Because none of this was unfamiliar and, to me, none of it was unconquerable. It seemed very similar, if not precisely, the battle I had lived. I appreciated the fact I had found someone who understood that, who connected me to my own past. I appreciated the opportunity to accept and support someone as I had always wanted to be accepted and supported, and I believed that connected us to a future. I thought he and I would get through it, and be the stronger for it on the other side. Just as I had done in my own life.

I’m still not sure where I was wrong. That lack of comprehension is what I still struggle with. Almost a year ago, after a period of saying he didn’t want to leave me but acting increasingly distant and difficult, after a relationship that included him pushing me to trust and rely on him, him telling me he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me and him living with me and my daughter in our home, he broke up with me by stopping talking to me. He just stopped returning my calls and texts. When I finally got a hold of him, days later, he said he was already gone. And that was it.

I managed a pseudo-conversation a couple of weeks later, in which he said he didn’t want to be in a relationship at all right now. He also said he would try to give me a better explanation for why after he got his thoughts together. Later, he angrily told me he was confused then and he would never have an explanation. A couple of months later, I got a phone discussion about it. He told me I should think about him like a natural disaster that had blown into my life, destroyed, and went away, and all I could do was move on and pick up the pieces. There were no explanations, nothing to do about it.

Are there circumstances where something breaks and there is simply no reason for it? Perhaps. When it comes to people and relationships, however, I doubt it. There are always reasons, even if they’re small ones, even if they’re justifiable ones.

It is true we can’t control everything. We actually can’t control much of anything. The thing is, it doesn’t matter. Even without control, we’re still responsible for doing our best. We’re still responsible for what we do. It’s not all bad. If we weren’t, we would never have credit for our accomplishments, for working hard and getting better. Without accountability, there’s no risk, and no achievement. Even if we have a relationship broken at no one’s fault, we have responsibility to discuss it and resolve it honestly. We have no control sometimes. But we always have the choice of being accountable for what we’ve done. I had learned long ago that I wanted to choose accountability, whatever price it demanded.

I began to go to therapy. I could no longer handle the pain on my own. I was determined to handle it somehow, though. And actually handle it, not simply go away from it as I had so often in my life before. Secrets keep people sick, and what goes unsaid and unexamined breeds fear. Silence and ambiguity kept me sick and afraid for the majority of my life. I had wasted enough of time running away from feeling, enough of my life shutting off consequences to make it easier on myself. I wanted to learn how to feel this, understand this, and grow from it.

That required thinking about myself, and my past. While I had made huge strides in being open and honest about who I was, I had spent a long time on a straight trajectory away from my early life. I am no longer in contact with most of my family. The one relationship I had come to better terms with was with my mother, who died of cancer almost three years ago. Something else I had to move away from. It had been a long time since I had carefully considered my past as a part of who I am, as a measure of accomplishment and a measure of what further work I had to do.

I managed to get Matt to come to a therapy session with me. He came with pre-packaged conversation points. That may sound unkind, but when you have loved someone and believed in their words, you have earned a sense for what is true and what is intended to sound plausible enough to be true. He said he left abruptly because he didn’t want to drag it out, out of kindness to me. He said again, as he had assured me several times already, he didn’t want to be in a relationship at all. As we began to peel the layers away, however, he said the closer he gets to something important, the more he becomes convinced he’ll screw it up. He said he is simply broken, defective.

His act of labeling himself “defective” is what stood out most to my therapist, and me as well, although for a different reason. For me, it was recognition. I remembered feeling like that. I spent most of my life feeling defective, that I was simply born wrong, or broken so early on I might as well have been born that way. I learned later on that it was really just a sign of massive self-doubt and lack of responsibility for my own self. In actuality, labeling myself as defective was nothing more than a cop-out. It was a way to avoid being accountable for growing up and improving myself, and a way to avoid having to address any mistakes I made. I’m broken. I’m not capable of doing better. It’s an insanity defense. Yes, I’m guilty, and, at the same time, I’m not responsible for what I did. I’m defective. That’s just the way it is. All you can do is let me go and chalk up whatever damage I did as something out of anyone’s control. A tragedy, like a natural disaster. And when I do it all over again, and damage someone else, that won’t be my fault, either.

Less than a couple months after he last told me, for about the sixth time, he had left me because he didn’t want a relationship at all, I saw him out with another girl. And I came face-to-face with months of being lied to, during the same time I had been trying desperately to find out the truth.

I have a very good idea why he thinks he did it. By not telling me the truth, by covering up the painful reality and sparing me the details of what he thought and felt, lying was kinder. It wasn’t even lying. It was an act of charity.

This sentiment is a disease we should eradicate from our collective culture. The condescending, “we know what’s best for you, so we’ll eliminate considering you as an individual in order to force it upon you.” Also, it often has not as much to do with kindness as it does with a weak person protecting his weakness. Kindness comes from taking the time and effort to fully understand another person and her needs. It is not the same thing as adopting some generally-accepted platitude without considering whether or not it truly applies to the situation at hand, and it’s not the same thing as rationalizing whatever is easiest for you personally. If anyone took the time to ask me what would be the kindest for me, I wouldn’t hesitate a second to say: the truth. If necessary, I could tell the entire story I’ve told here to explain why. It’s very clear to me. It always has been. Maybe I don’t really care about or need kindness in the first place.

I know there’s also another “plausible” reason: he did and said what he thought was true at the time, but it turned out not to be. It is possible to make mistakes. Clearly, I have. But I don’t think his intent was to be honest. I think his intent was to avoid and come up with a rationalization for it that would let him off of the hook. I don’t think he did that consciously. But he did it all the same. I know that trick. The power of human denial is an incredible thing.

The thing is, the truth isn’t about the words. It’s not about what sounds right or what is kind and proper to say. It’s not even about the facts. It’s about expressing honestly what’s inside you. It’s that act of expression. That’s truth. And you know when you’re not getting it from someone. No matter what is exactly said. Or not said.

Very recently, after a long period of no contact, our paths crossed. He sought me out to see if everything was okay now. It was like nothing had ever happened. Even when the present situation was clearly different. As long as we acted like nothing bad had ever happened, nothing had.

I don’t do that anymore.

Is it a grudge? Is it dwelling? I don’t think so. And I’ve thought about it, carefully. I watched how the damaged people around me ended up paying for their own mismanaged mistakes and I paid attention to that. My mother was abandoned by my half-sister’s father quite early on, and lived a hard life with few resources and virtually no help. She saw herself as a victim, and it was not entirely untrue. But she reacted to victimhood with anger and bitterness. She bottled it all up inside and, apart from flashes of passive-aggressiveness, it fermented and stewed. She refused to discuss anything. She was incapable facing any uncomfortable reality.

I will never have any idea how long she had the cancer before we found out about it. Because she didn’t have medical insurance, she tried to fix what she was feeling was wrong with changes in diet. Eventually, the cancer ruptured her colon and she was unable to walk. She finally had to go to the hospital, where they discovered the cause. Even then, she managed to keep most of the truth from the family. Initially, we thought it was manageable and we supported her through chemotherapy. It was another few months before I realized there really was no hope and there likely hadn’t ever been. It was eight months from the time my mother was first hospitalized to the time she died, at age fifty-five. She denied it to the end. She did not come to terms with dying and she did not make peace with people she left behind. I think she felt cheated. Maybe she had been. I had learned sympathy for her and had dismissed any resentment before she even got sick. I knew she loved and worried about me, and she was a good grandmother. But I also knew she lived bitter and unhappy and thwarted, and I watched her die that way, far before her time.

No, I won’t hold on to anger.

But I won’t repress it, either.

It’s a difficult and careful balance between expressing your pain and anger and letting it consume you. But it’s possible. More than that, I think that balance is where you grow. You can’t shut out either side. You have to manage both. I am still very hurt and I am still very confused. I feel foolish I cared so much and I feel foolish that, while I cared, I was used, lied to, unceremoniously dumped and easily replaced. I thought I was smarter than to fall for that. So there’s stinging pride, as well. I trusted someone because he asked me to, and then he betrayed that so profoundly.

People and relationships break. They do so far too easily, in fact. Sometimes, it’s for the best. Sometimes, it shouldn’t happen. I’ve known a lot of broken people. Some of them are unsalvageable, as are my relationships with them. I once thought I was unsalvageable, because I came from broken people and inherited their sins. Then I discovered the only real sin is denying potential because of weakness or fear.

You look back and follow the line of the path behind you, and eventually it leads you to where you are. This past year, I’ve been merciless in examining myself and holding myself to the same standard to which I wish others held themselves. I’ve fallen short. I’ve tried again. I’ve figured out that the pain I feel now has roots beyond the present, and that I have to pull the entire thing out or it will just pop up somewhere else later on. I’m still in therapy. I got a new, promising job. I'm in a new home and more financially stable than I have been in my entire life. I am building good things. I am, in my way, getting better. After all, I’ve come this far.

I learned that you can in fact beat your own demons. But you can’t fight someone else’s for him. Even if you really want to.

I learned that forgiveness is not forgetting. I can forgive and let go, but consequences remain. I wouldn’t be doing anyone any favors by dismissing them. Just as I wouldn’t be doing myself any favors by dismissing my own. Instead, I remember, and I write it all down, and I tell the truth about it. And I learn from it. This has actually been harder than I thought it would be when I started. It must have done something important.

Every evening, before she goes to bed, my daughter and I have what I call our “chats.” I sit down with her and ask her what she’s thinking about. Or what she wants to ask me or what is worrying her or what is making her happy or what she wants me to tell her. She’s six years old. Usually she wants to talk about Pokemon or cats. But that’s fine, because it’s not about what we talk about. It’s about her understanding that I’m taking the time to listen to her, and the time to let her ask me questions and that I care about the communication between us. I can’t always make her understand. When my mom died, and my daughter didn’t know where her grandmother was, I explained to her as honestly, although mostly unsuccessfully, as I could what happens when people get sick and die. When Matt left, it was a much harder explanation, because I didn’t really have an explanation. So I told her that. I told her I didn’t understand why people who said they loved you leave without explaining why, but that happens too. After he left, she asked me a few times if I would leave her.

I told her I would be with her in every way I can as long as I possibly can. Because that’s the truth.
